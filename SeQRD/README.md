This is a very old Android project I built around circa 2013, when I was still a beginner in programming. I found the files after some spring cleaning of my old system and thought it should be up here for posterity.
The app basically decodes a scanned QR code and runs a custom phishing detection algorithm on any detected URL links and warns the user of any possible phishing attack.
